# BikeSharing Analysis

## Overview

One of the main objectives of Data Analytics to is to be able to tell a story by showing visualizations that provides answers
to business questions.  This module asked students to analyze bike trip data from a NYC bike rental program to
provide information to investors for a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.

The analysis required us to read data using Pandas and convert a tripduration field to a datetime data type to be used
as a dimension for use in Tableau Visualizations. 

Tableau is a non-coding tool that will take large amounts of data that students used to plot bike trip data points such as
trip duration, bike checkout dates and times, and rider gender.  Tableau also has the ability to add filters, connect to different
datasources such as an Excel spreadsheet, text files, and databases.

The visualizations help communicate information in a graphical way instead of looking at a bunch of numbers on spreadsheets.  
It is very important for the data scientist to provide the story points needed so that stakeholders can make business
decisions.
