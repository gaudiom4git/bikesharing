# BikeSharing Analysis

## Overview

One of Data Analysis main objectives to is to able to tell a story by showing visualizations that provides answers
to business questions.  This module asked students to analyze bike trip data from a NYC bike rental program to
provide information to investors for a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.

The analysis required us to read data using Pandas and convert a tripduration field to a datetime data type to be used
as a dimension for use in Tableau Visualizations. 

Tableau is a non-coding tool that will take large amounts of data that students used to plot bike trip data points such as
trip duration, bike checkout dates and times, and rider gender.  Tableau also has the ability to filters, connect to different
datasources such as an Excel spreadsheet, text files, and databases.

The visualizations help communicate information in a graphical way that instead of looking at a bunch of spreadsheets.  
It is very important for the data scientist to provide the story points needed so that stakeholders can make business
decisions
